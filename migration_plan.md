# Migration Plan: Express to NestJS

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the existing Express.js backend to a new NestJS project. The goal is to leverage NestJS's architecture to improve scalability, maintainability, and developer experience.

## 1. Project Structure

The current project follows a classic MVC-like pattern. NestJS has a modular, controller-service based architecture.

**Old Structure (Express):**

```
src/
├── controllers/
├── Dal/
├── models/
├── Routes/
├── Service/
└── utils/
```

**New Structure (NestJS):**

NestJS promotes organizing code by feature modules. Each module will encapsulate controllers, services, and other related components.

```
src/
├── app.module.ts
├── main.ts
├── users/
│   ├── users.module.ts
│   ├── users.controller.ts
│   ├── users.service.ts
│   └── schemas/
│       └── user.schema.ts
├── products/
│   └── ...
└── ... (other feature modules)
```

## 2. Configuration

Environment variables are currently managed with a `.env` file. In NestJS, we will use the `@nestjs/config` module to handle this. This provides a structured way to access configuration properties throughout the application.

## 3. Database

The current project uses Mongoose. We will use the `@nestjs/mongoose` package to integrate Mongoose with NestJS. The database connection will be configured in the root `AppModule`.

## 4. Migration Steps by Component

### a. Models/Schemas

The existing Mongoose schemas (`*.ts` files in `src/models/`) can be migrated with minimal changes. We will move them into the corresponding feature module's `schemas` directory.

### b. Data Access Layer (DAL)

The `Dal` files contain the logic for interacting with the database. This logic will be moved into the `Service` of each feature module. NestJS's dependency injection will be used to inject the Mongoose models into the services.

### c. Services

The business logic from the existing `Service` files will be moved into the new NestJS `Service` classes.

### d. Controllers & Routes

The Express `Controllers` and `Routes` will be combined into NestJS `Controllers`. NestJS controllers use decorators (`@Controller`, `@Get`, `@Post`, etc.) to define routes and handle requests.

### e. Validation

The current validation logic (likely using a library like Joi or custom validators) will be replaced with NestJS `ValidationPipes`. These pipes leverage decorators and class-validator to provide powerful and declarative validation.

### f. Middleware

Express middleware will be migrated to NestJS middleware, guards, or interceptors, depending on their function.

## 5. Testing

Existing tests will need to be adapted to the NestJS testing framework, which is built on top of Jest. NestJS provides a testing utility package (`@nestjs/testing`) that simplifies the process of creating a testing environment and mocking dependencies.

## 6. Phased Migration

The migration will be done feature by feature to minimize disruption. The `todo.md` file breaks down the specific tasks for each feature.
